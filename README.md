# Data Workflows 
This project provides a framework for building, automating, and managing data workflows. It aims to simplify the process of transforming, processing, and analyzing data in a structured and repeatable manner. By leveraging modular components, this project allows users to define data pipelines that can be executed with ease.

# Features

- Modular Data Pipelines: Build custom data workflows with reusable components.
- Automation: Automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- Error Handling: Built-in error handling and logging for robust data processing.
- Extensibility: Easily extend workflows to include custom data processing tasks.
